Over time, we developed a special methodology for web development training, thanks to which our students acquired deep knowledge of web programming.We present three stages of teaching: Full Stack, Front end, Back end. Before choosing one of the stages, we talk to the students who are interested in us, knowing their purpose in the specialization of web programming, we recommend the professional stage of the preferred programming courses. Webex Technologies offers the students to choose online or stationary courses.",

    "descr_online": "The advantage of an online course is that you can learn web programming in any country in the world.",
    "descr_stationary": "The advantage of a stationary course is that you learn individually, under the direct supervision of a programmer.",
    "main_goal": {
      "title": "The purpose of our teaching is to train strong specialists",
      "text": "To this end, students are given practical programming knowledge, individually, by web developers with 15 years of experience who will patiently explain all the nuances of programming and prove to you that there is nothing difficult in programming. We try to make our lessons accessible to everyone, so we have created an opportunity to learn online programming. This gives students the opportunity to learn the most complex programming algorithms anywhere and anytime. At the end of the course, students will receive a certificate verifying that the student is a qualified web developer.

        "title": "Procedure",
        "0": "First, an interview is conducted, as a result of which we find out the initial knowledge of the <strong>student</strong>. Based on the results of this interview, it is decided whether he has to start from the beginning or from the middle of the curriculum.",
        "1": "Classes are held on an <strong>individual</strong> basis, it means that we are training with each student individually in the classroom or online. There can be up to 10 students (it’s also possible only you may be in the classroom or online if the <strong>teacher-programmer</strong> decides that there is a need to explain to you certain topics in detail).",
        "2": "A <strong>video lesson</strong> is given to each student, after which the teacher answers your questions, and if there are no questions, we pass to the task, which is given during the lesson, if necessary.",
        "3": "At the end of the lesson, a <strong>homework</strong> is given on this topic. In the next lesson, the task is checked by the teacher, if there are failed parts, it is discussed by the teacher.",
        "4": "If the student has difficulties while performing the task, the teacher will never move forward ․ This topic is explained again and the student gets a new task. This method prolongs the number of student classes, but we get a guaranteed quality, and those who graduate from us at the end becоme stable specialists.",
        "5": "At the end of the courses, the student receives a <strong>certificate</strong> that he/she is a qualified specialist.",
        "6": "After completing the courses, we also guarantee that specialist to our partner organizations or we offer to the bests of them  <strong>internship</strong> in our company and also offer a <strong>job</strong> with us if they manifest themselves well."

        "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
        "q_0": "The duration of the courses",
        "a_00": "The duration of the courses directly depends on the student's ability to perceive quickly. The sooner the student understands the topics, the sooner the courses will end, because we do not move forward until we understand that the student has finally understood the topic. It should be noted, however, that the main course ( ",
        "a_01": ") has so far lasted at least 7 months and at most 15 months.",
        "q_1": "How much does the course cost?",
        "a_1": "The cost of an individual training course both online and stationary is 50,000 AMD. We do not provide group training at WebEx, as its efficiency is incomparably small. The lessons last 1.5 hours, three times a week. The price includes 12 lessons per month.",
        "q_2": "What time can you participate in the lesson?",
        "a_2": "Since the lessons are individual, you can participate in the lessons at the time convenient for you, of course, agreeing in advance with the teacher.",
        "q_3": "What topics are we studying?",
        "a_3": "Note that there is no one who knows all the programming knowledge, our main role is to separate the main topics from the secondary ones."
